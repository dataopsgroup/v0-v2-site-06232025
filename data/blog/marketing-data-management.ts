    <h2>It's All About the Data</h2>
    
    <h3>Is Poor Data Quality Undermining Your Marketing Decisions?</h3>
    <p>For many marketing teams, the reality of data management is far from ideal—messy data scattered across multiple systems, inconsistent naming conventions, and an inability to clearly demonstrate marketing's impact on revenue.</p>
    
    <p>According to Forrester Research, poor data quality costs businesses an average of 10-25% of their revenue. This aligns with our findings on <a href="/insights/hidden-revenue-leak">how poor sales data quality costs companies millions</a>.</p>
    
    <h4>Your marketing team may be struggling with:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Inconsistent or unreliable marketing data across platforms</li>
      <li>Inability to clearly attribute revenue to marketing efforts</li>
      <li>Confusing or limited marketing dashboards and reports</li>
      <li>Data silos preventing unified customer visibility</li>
      <li>Lack of trusted metrics to guide marketing decisions</li>
      <li>Difficulty proving marketing's contribution to the bottom line</li>
      <li>Time-consuming manual data compilation and reporting processes</li>
      <li>Incomplete customer journey visibility</li>
      <li>Incompatible data formats across marketing platforms</li>
      <li>Uncertainty about which metrics really matter for your business</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>The Problem: The Marketing Data Mess</h2>
    <p>Most marketing organizations collect vast amounts of data but struggle to transform it into meaningful insights.</p>
    
    <p>According to HubSpot, 67% of marketers say improving data quality is their biggest analytics challenge, while Gartner reports that 60% of CMOs will slash their marketing analytics efforts due to failed promised value.</p>
    
    <p>The gap between data collection and meaningful insights isn't just frustrating—it's costing your business real money through missed opportunities, wasted marketing spend, and inability to demonstrate marketing's true value.</p>
    
    <p>This challenge is compounded when companies lack proper <a href="/insights/forgotten-art-campaign-documentation">campaign documentation</a> and struggle with <a href="/insights/demystifying-utm-parameters">UTM parameter implementation</a>, making attribution even more difficult.</p>
