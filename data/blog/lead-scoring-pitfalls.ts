    <h3>Four Tips for Your Lead Scoring Model</h3>
    
    <p>Marketers are always looking for more intelligence they can glean from their data. With multiple campaigns in-market, their programs are attracting net-new contacts daily. But which of these new contacts are worth nurturing with the goal of passing them along to Sales for next steps?</p>
    
    <p>Below are four quick bits of advice we are sharing when it comes to building your lead score model.</p>
    
    <p>This builds on our comprehensive guide to <a href="/insights/create-pro-level-hubspot-lead-score-model">creating pro-level HubSpot lead scoring models</a>, providing practical tips to avoid common implementation mistakes.</p>

    <h3>Key Lead Scoring Categories</h3>
    
    <p>The three key categories for building a lead scoring matrix are:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Firmographic data</strong> - Demographic details of contacts or companies</li>
      <li><strong>Behavioral information</strong> - Interactions and engagement levels</li>
      <li><strong>Negative attributes</strong> - Characteristics that disqualify or de-prioritize leads</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Advanced lead scoring techniques help in monitoring and prioritizing leads based on their level of engagement and fit with the ideal customer profile. It allows businesses to automate processes, such as changing life cycle stages, and effectively manage resources by focusing on leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers.</p>
    
    <h3>Customization and Implementation</h3>
    
    <p>Lead scoring can be customized based on specific criteria by assigning points to positive attributes, such as form submissions or email clicks, and subtracting points for negative attributes, like competitor email domains or certain job titles. These criteria can be refined further by specifying time frames, frequency of actions, and even by the type of content or pages viewed.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Avoid creating too many "what if" scenarios in your model's design.</strong> You cannot account for every possibility. Focus on the most common scenarios instead.</p>
    
    <h3>Implementation Best Practices</h3>
    
    <p>When implementing lead scoring, it's important to consider its impact on workflows, lists, and life cycle stages. Ensure that the scoring system aligns with the overall sales and marketing strategy and regularly review and adjust the scoring criteria as needed.</p>
    
    <p>Be cautious of potential pitfalls, such as over-scoring or under-scoring leads, which can lead to inefficient resource allocation and misalignment between sales and marketing efforts.</p>
    
    <p>Last, be sure to create a feedback mechanism, such as a standing call, from Sales on the leads you pass to them. Their feedback will help you refine your model, making it better over time.</p>
    
    <p>This feedback loop is crucial for maintaining data quality and ensuring your lead scoring remains effective - similar to the ongoing maintenance required for <a href="/insights/crm-cleanup-plan">CRM data quality</a>.</p>
