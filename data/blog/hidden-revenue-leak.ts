    <p>While you're focused on closing deals, your CRM's data quality is quietly draining your revenue potential. According to Salesforce Research, companies lose between 10-30% of potential revenue due to poor sales data quality—yet 67% of sales leaders don't even realize this leak exists.</p>
    
    <p>The consequences are immediate and severe. Harvard Business Review reports that salespeople waste nearly 30% of their time dealing with inaccurate, incomplete, or duplicate data rather than selling. That's almost a third of your payroll investment disappearing into data maintenance.</p>
    
    <p>The most alarming statistic? Gartner found that organizations believe poor data quality costs them an average of $12.9 million annually. For sales-driven organizations, this manifests as:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Missed opportunities</strong> when leads aren't properly tracked</li>
      <li><strong>Inaccurate sales forecasts</strong> leading to poor resource allocation</li>
      <li><strong>Misaligned territories</strong> causing conflict and inefficiency</li>
      <li><strong>Lost insights</strong> that could accelerate deal velocity</li>
      <li><strong>Inflated customer acquisition costs</strong> due to poor <a href="/insights/customer-acquisition-cost">CAC calculation accuracy</a></li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>But the solution isn't just implementing better technology. Sirius Decisions research shows that successful organizations implement clear data governance policies alongside their CRM investments, achieving 25% higher revenue growth than those focusing on technology alone.</p>
    
    <p>This is why our <a href="/insights/crm-cleanup-plan">90-day CRM cleanup methodology</a> focuses not just on data cleansing, but on establishing sustainable processes that prevent future data decay.
