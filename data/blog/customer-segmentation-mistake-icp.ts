    <p>"Who's your ideal customer?"</p>
    
    <p>If your answer is a generic industry, company size, and job title, you're leaving money on the table. Big time.</p>
    
    <p>After helping dozens of B2B companies analyze their customer data, I've found that most "ideal customer profiles" are based on gut feelings and outdated assumptions—not actual revenue data.</p>
    
    <p>The truth? Your most profitable customers rarely match your marketing personas.</p>
    
    <p>One client was convinced their ideal customer was enterprise healthcare companies with 1000+ employees. When we dove into their CRM data, we discovered their highest-converting, longest-retaining customers were actually mid-market education organizations. For YEARS they had been investing against the wrong target!</p>
    
    <p>This happens because most companies create customer profiles based on who they WANT to sell to, not who ACTUALLY buys and stays.</p>
    
    <p>Even worse, they create these profiles once and never revisit them, ignoring the critical data that accumulates with every new customer acquisition.</p>
    
    <p>Here's what smart companies do instead:</p>
    
    <p>They analyze their CRM data quarterly to identify which customer attributes actually correlate with:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Shortest sales cycles</li>
      <li>Highest close rates</li>
      <li>Largest initial deal sizes</li>
      <li>Highest retention</li>
      <li>Most expansion revenue</li>
      <li>Lowest support costs</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Even more, best performing companies look at who their best customers are. They write case studies of those customer to understand who they are, their challenges, how they overcame those with the purchased solution or product. These case studies serve as a template to find similar customers. If prospect B is 80% the same as customer A, you are likely to win prospect B as a new customer.</p>
    
    <p>The combination of these factors reveals your TRUE ideal customer—not the fiction sitting in your marketing strategy document.</p>
    
    <p>One e-commerce SaaS company I worked with discovered that customers who asked specific integration questions during sales calls had 76% higher lifetime value than those who focused on pricing. Guess what became their new lead qualification criteria?</p>
    
    <p>Your HubSpot database is FULL of these insights. But they're buried under layers of messy data and inconsistent tracking.</p>
    
    <p>Want to uncover who your actual ideal customer is? I help companies mine their CRM data to build customer segments based on reality, not wishful thinking.</p>
