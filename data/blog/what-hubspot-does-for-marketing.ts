    <h2>What does HubSpot do for marketing?</h2>
    
    <p>If you're a marketer, you've probably heard of HubSpot. It's an all-in-one marketing platform that helps businesses grow by attracting, engaging, and delighting customers. In this blog post, we'll explore the features and benefits of HubSpot and how they can help you with your marketing efforts.</p>
    
    <p>This foundational understanding becomes crucial when implementing advanced strategies like <a href="/insights/3-tips-for-smart-workflows">smart workflows</a> and <a href="/insights/create-pro-level-hubspot-lead-score-model">professional lead scoring models</a>.</p>
    
    <h4>Attracting Customers</h4>
    
    <p>One of the key features of HubSpot is its ability to help you attract customers to your business. Here are some of the ways it does this:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</strong>: HubSpot has built-in SEO tools that help you optimize your website and blog content for search engines. This can help you rank higher in search results and attract more traffic to your site.</li>
      <li><strong>Social Media</strong>: HubSpot makes it easy to schedule and publish social media posts, monitor social media activity, and analyze your social media performance.</li>
      <li><strong>Content Creation</strong>: HubSpot provides templates and tools for creating engaging blog posts, emails, landing pages, and other content that can attract customers to your business. HubSpot also launched in April 2023 new AI tools to help you create better content faster.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>For maximum effectiveness, these attraction strategies should be combined with proper <a href="/insights/demystifying-utm-parameters">UTM parameter tracking</a> to measure campaign performance accurately.</p>
    
    <h4>Engaging Customers</h4>
    
    <p>Once you've attracted customers to your business, the next step is to engage them. HubSpot helps you do this in several ways:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Email Marketing</strong>: HubSpot's email marketing tools allow you to create and send targeted email campaigns to your customers and track their engagement.</li>
      <li><strong>Marketing Automation</strong>: HubSpot's marketing automation tools allow you to automate your marketing campaigns and personalize your messaging based on customer behavior.</li>
      <li><strong>Lead Nurturing</strong>: HubSpot's lead nurturing tools help you build relationships with your leads and move them through the sales funnel.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Effective engagement requires clean, organized data. Without proper <a href="/insights/crm-cleanup-plan">CRM hygiene</a>, even the best engagement strategies will fall short of their potential.</p>
    
    <h4>Delighting Customers</h4>
    
    <p>Finally, HubSpot helps you delight your customers by providing them a great experience. Here are some of the ways it does this:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Customer Service</strong>: HubSpot's customer service tools help you manage customer inquiries and issues, and track customer satisfaction.</li>
      <li><strong>Surveys</strong>: HubSpot's survey tools allow you to gather customer feedback and use that feedback to improve your products and services.</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics</strong>: HubSpot's analytics tools provide insights into your marketing performance, so you can make data-driven decisions and improve your marketing efforts over time.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Understanding customer satisfaction and retention is crucial for identifying potential <a href="/insights/customer-churn-blindspot">churn risks</a> and maximizing customer lifetime value.</p>
    
    <h4>Getting Professional Help</h4>
    
    <p>While HubSpot offers powerful tools, maximizing their potential often requires expert guidance. Consider <a href="/insights/hiring-and-working-with-a-hubspot-consultant">working with a HubSpot consultant</a> to ensure you're leveraging all available features effectively.</p>
